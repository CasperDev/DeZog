	<br>zxnext configuration: Now the ZXNext can be connected via serial interface directly from DeZog. There is no need anymore to
	go through the extra program DeZogSerialInterface.
	For this there are changes to the "zxnext" launch.json configuration.
	See chapter <a href="https://github.com/maziac/DeZog/blob/master/documentation/Usage.md#zx-next--serial-interface">ZX Next / Serial Interface</a> for more information.
