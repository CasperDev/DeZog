	<br>Unit tests: Since version 1.60 vscode contains an API for executing unit tests. DeZog v2.4 has been changed to use it. This means: the "Z80 Unit Tests" extension is not required anymore, you should de-install it. In general you should be able to use the new UI without any configuration change. Apart from that please read the <a href="https://github.com/maziac/DeZog/blob/master/documentation/Migration.md">migration</a> document.

	<br>Setting expressions: For years vscode was not able to set values in the WACTHes pane. Last month I decided to
	implement a workaround for this and released 2.3: the 'Expressions' section was added to the VARIABLES pane. This
	was bad timing. 4 weeks later with vscode 1.60 the setting of values was also supported by vscode. So I removed the
	'Expressions' from the VARIABLES pane again. With this also the commands '-addexpr' and '-delexpr' have been
	removed.
	Instead, in the WATCHes pane, you can now right click and select 'Set value' to change the value.

	<br>Debug session restart: the behavior has been reverted somewhat. It is now possible to re-assemble your sources and do a restart. Additionally also the launch.json is re-read.
	On the flip-side of this the memory views are closed on a restart.

	<br>"Disassembly at Cursor" has been optimized. now not only 1 line is disassembled. If you have selected a few lines all of these lines are disassembled.

<li>
	<span class="changelog-badge changelog-badge-fixed">FIXED</span>
	<br>Windows: the code coverage was not shown at all. This is fixed. You should see now all covered lines with a dark green background color.
