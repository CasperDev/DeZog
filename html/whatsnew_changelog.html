	<br>Setting expressions: For years vscode was not able to set values in the WACTHes pane. Last month I decided to implement a workaround for this and released 2.3: the 'Expressions' section was added to the VARIABLES pane. This was bad timing. 4 weeks later with vscode 1.60 the setting of values was also supported by vscode. So I removed the 'Expressions' from the VARIABLES pane again. With this also the commands '-addexpr' and '-delexpr' have been removed.
	Instead, in the WATCHes pane, you can now right click and select 'Set value' to change the value.

	<br>Debug session restart: the behavior has been reverted somewhat. It is now possible to re-assemble your sources and do a restart. Additionally also the launch.json is re-read.
	On the flip-side of this the memory views are closed on a restart.

	<br>"Disassembly at Cursor" has been optimized. now not only 1 line is disassembled. If you have selected a few lines all of these lines are disassembled.

	<br>Windows: the code coverage was not shown at all. This is fixed. You should see now all covered lines with a dark green background color.
