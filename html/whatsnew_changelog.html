	<br>Added "-addvar" and "-rmvar" console commands: See help ("-h") in the debug console. With addvar you can add labels to the VARIABLES pane. With rmvar you can remove it. Functionality is similar to the WATCHes pane. But if you add labels to VARIABLES you are able to modify values. The WATCHes pan just allows to display values.
