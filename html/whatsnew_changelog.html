	<span class="changelog-badge changelog-badge-new">NEW</span>
	<br>Added "-addexpr" and "-delexpr" console commands: See help ("-h") in the debug console. With addexpr you can add labels to the VARIABLES pane. With delexpr you can remove it. Functionality is similar to the WATCHes pane. But if you add labels to VARIABLES you are able to modify values. The WATCHes pane just allows to display values.

	<span class="changelog-badge changelog-badge-new">NEW</span>
	<br>Added "-msetb" and "-msetw" console commands: See help ("-h") in the debug console. With mset you can change single memory locations or fill a complete area. You can fill by byte or word and use little or big endian.

<li>
	<span class="changelog-badge changelog-badge-new">NEW</span>
	<br>Added console command "-mvw" to display a memory viewer that displays the memory organized in words instead of bytes. You can use either little or big endian.

<li>
	<span class="changelog-badge changelog-badge-changed">CHANGED</span>
	<br>Debug session restart (the green debug button with the circle arrow) now behaves differently. In the past it has been simply a short cut for STOP and RUN a new debug session. Now it just reloads the binary file and restarts it. I.e. all additional setup you have done, e.g. adding memory views through the console, will persist now (until you stop the debug session with the red square button).

	<br>Register colors in memory views were not updated if the memory view was not focused.
